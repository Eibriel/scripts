###eLinker Addon

####Link and Cache with one click!

Linking elements to an scene was a tedious process, until now!

eLinker helps to link character, props and more to your scene, with just a few clicks, without browsing files. You can also switch between High and Low resolution models after you link them, and while you animate. When you are done with animation you can bake it to a Mesh Cache, and apply skin fixing, shading, etc..

####Designed for studios, build for everyone!


Do no matter if you are a freelancer, a small studio, or a big production. This workflow was tested and proved to be efficient and fast. Using linked elements you keep the files clean, lightweight and manageable; just make the maths relative. Get rid of repetitive processes, and gain time for the artistic iteration.

 
####Share your setup!

eLinker is fully customizable, you can add as many Libraries of Items you want. You can name every Library, and set a custom folder where eLinker will look for Items.

You can also save the settings to an external file to share it at your studio.
